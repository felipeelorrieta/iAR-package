\title{Summary Method for unidata Objects}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class `unidata`. This object contains the fitted 
iAR model, including parameters such as coefficients (`coef`), 
standard errors (`stderr`), t-values (`tvalue`), p-values (`pvalue`), 
family type (`family`), and other model-specific parameters.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused).}
}
\description{
This method provides a summary of the `unidata` object, which represents 
an iAR (irregular autoregressive) model. The summary includes information 
about the model family (e.g., "normal", "t", "gamma"), the coefficients, 
standard errors, t-values, and p-values. The output is formatted to display 
the relevant statistics based on the model family.
